## Day 1 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
-  Went through the Dart Programming Language from Official Documentation and used [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) as a tool
-  Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. A tour of the Dart language is handy in this case. [Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
-  I had already installed the Flutter environment on my system. So, I skipped [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) step and moved ahead.
-  Created the First Project on Day 1 and modified the default counter app.
